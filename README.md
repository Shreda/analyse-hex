This repo contains the result of me tring to analyse the passwords generated by a 'forgot my password' functionality of a website. I wanted to determine if the application was limiting generated passwords to a certain subset of hex values.

## pull_emails.py
This script connects to my mailbox via IMAP and retrieves each email from the mailbox. For each email it uses regex to grab the generated hex password located in the email and prints the value to stdout.

## analyse_passwords.c
This C program performs some simple arithmetic on the values to find potentials duplicates and the range of generated hex values.
